# Drozerah Human

A short piece of code to get in touch with me that I use in my projects. It is composed of a SVG icon nested with a link to [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Drozerah) plus, informations directly coded as comments in the HTML.
In adition, the ```<head>``` contain an author tag to link a ```humans.txt``` file and give more informations about the author, the team or the project.

If you want to learn more about the ```humans.txt file```, you can go to [About humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/).
